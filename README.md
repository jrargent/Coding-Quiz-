## Things I learned in making this quiz:
 This was an incredibly difficult project for me. I focused on finishing the functionality before focusing on the CSS styling and ran out of time to finish the styling. I plan to come back to this in the future to finish up the styling. 
 
 - Gained a better understanding of JavaScript and the HTML DOM
 - Gained a much better understanding of how functions work
 - Global and Local variable scope
 - Using localStorage and JSON stringify/parse, and using get/setitem methods. 

I also learned a valuable lesson about knowing when to get up and walk away. I need to not get so wrapped up in a project that I spend hours and hours on a section of it, to the detriment of getting the rest of it done.
